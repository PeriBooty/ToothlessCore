# Make your console outputs colored!

(yes, I know this has been done a ton of times before, but whatever)

## How to use
```js
const clr = require("coloredtext");
console.log(clr.raw.fg.list) // to get a list of the foreground colors available
console.log(clr.raw.bg.list) // to get a list of the background colors available
console.log(clr.blink(clr.bg.green(clr.white("Hello, world!")))); // prints the blinking string "Hello, world!" with white text and green background.
console.log(clr.bg.white(clr.blue("Hello, world!"))) // prints the string "Hello, world!" with blue text and white background.
```
There is also support for underline and bold.
